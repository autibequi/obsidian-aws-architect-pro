# High Peformance Computing
- Data Management & Transfer
	- AWS Direct Connect
		- Move GB/s of data to the cloud
		- over a private secure network
	- AWS Snowball & AWS Snowmobile
		- Move PB of Data to the cloud
	- AWS DataSync
		- Move large amounts of data between
			- S3
			- EFS
			- FSX for Windows 
- Compute and Networking
	- EC2 Intances
		- CPU optimized
		- GPU optimized
		- Spot Instances / Spot fleets + Auto Scaling
	- EC2 Placement Group
		- Cluters (same rack)
			- For good Network Performance
		- EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV) #focus 
			- Higher bandwidth 
			- higher PPS (packets per seconds)
			- lower latency
			- How to get it?
				- Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100Gbps
				- Intel 82599VF up to 10Gbps - Legacy
		- Elastic Fabric Adapter #focus 
			- Improved ENA for HPC
			- Only works for linux
			- Great for inter-node communication
			- Leverage Message Passing Interface (MPI) Standart
			- Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport
- Storage
	- Instance Attached Storage
		- EBS
			- Scale up to 256.000 IOPS with io2 Block Express #focus 
		- Instance Storage
			- Scales to millions of IOPS
			- Linked to EC2 instance Hardware
			- Low latency
		- Network Storage
			- S3
				- Large Blobs
				- Not a File System
			- EFS
				- Scale IOPS based on total Size
				- or use provisioned IOPS
			- FSx for Lustre (linux)
				- HPC optimized distributed file system
				- millions of IOPS
				- backed by S3
- Automation and Orchestration
	- AWS Batch
		- Support multi-node parallel Jobs
		- Enables run single jobs that span multiples EC2
		- Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 Instances accordingly
	- AWS ParallelCluster
		- Open Source Cluster Management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
		- Configure with text files
		- Automaet creation of
			- VPC
			- Subnet
			- Cluster Type
			- Instance Types
