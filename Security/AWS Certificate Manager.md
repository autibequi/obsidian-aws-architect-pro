# AWS Certificate Manager
- to host a public SSL in AWS you can
	- Buy your own and upload using cli
	- have ACM provision and renew public SSL certs for you (for free)
- ACM loads SSL certiicates on the following integrations
	- Load Balancers (including the ones created by EB)
	- Cloudfront Distributions
	- API on APi Gateway
- Auto renewed
- Regional Service
	- Need to create an SSL certificate to each region where used
	- You cant copy from one to another
	- If you use [[AWS CloudFront]] its a global service so it kinda fix it
